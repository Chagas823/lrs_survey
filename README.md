# Exploring Linkable Ring Signatures to Ensure Anonymity and Authenticity in Survey Research: A Methodological Design Proposal and Architectural Model
## üó∫Ô∏è Motivation 
Surveys play a significant role in various domains involving Information Systems, spanning from science to business contexts and public governance. These methods are pivotal for decision-making in organizations. However, many surveys encounter issues regarding the accuracy of information, as users often respond with incorrect data due to concerns about anonymity. Another challenge arises when unauthorized users participate in surveys, leading to inaccurate data.

Given these challenges, there arises a need to explore cryptographic algorithms that can assist in addressing this issue. Consequently, the Vicunlable Ring Signature scheme, which aims to ensure respondent anonymity, verify if two signatures were issued by the same group member, and identify from which group a signature originated, emerges as a potential viable solution.

## üìç Proposal 
In light of these issues, this study aims to develop an open-source web application/model that can be utilized, expanded, and studied in survey research. To achieve this goal, the Vicunlable Ring Signature scheme is employed as the solution.

Additionally, a methodology and architecture are proposed for implementation.
